# Getting started with this sample project

This project was created to help you get started quickly with [Paper Checkout Elements](https://docs.paper.xyz/docs/how-checkout-elements-work). This boilerplate uses a [custom ERC721 contract](https://github.com/paperxyz/custom-contract-ERC721). To play around with the sample project without cloning the repo locally, you can checkout out the same example deployed here: https://sample-project-paper-checkout-elements.vercel.app/

## Instructions

To clone this repo, open up your favorite code editor. I use VS Code. You can run 'git clone https://github.com/paperxyz/sample-project.git' in your terminal where you'd like this repository to live. Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.

Runs the app in the development mode with `npm run dev` in your terminal.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Here is what the app will look like:
